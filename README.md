## Abstract

We investigate the use of cross-validation (CV) techniques to estimate the
accuracy of equivalent-source (also known as equivalent-layer) interpolation
and processing of potential-field data.
Our preliminary results indicate that some common CV algorithms (e.g., random
permutations and k-folds) tend to overestimate the accuracy.
Prior research from the statistical modelling of ecological data suggests that
this is due to spatial auto-correlation of the data.
Indeed, we have found more conservative accuracy estimates when applying
blocked CV methods, where the data are split along spatial blocks instead of
randomly.
